# EKS-auto-deploy

Alright ‚Äî here‚Äôs the deployment workflow cheat sheet for all the files I gave you, in the correct order and with where they should live.

1Ô∏è‚É£ CloudFormation Infrastructure Setup
These files set up your private EKS environment + networking + optional components.

File	Purpose	: Where to run it,	When to run it

sg-endpoints.yaml	Creates Security Groups & VPC Endpoints so private EKS and CodeBuild can function without internet.	Run via AWS CLI or Console from your laptop.	First, before anything else.

bastion.yaml	Creates a Bastion Host in a private subnet (with SSM Session Manager access).	Optional ‚Äî only if you want shell access to private subnets.	After sg-endpoints.yaml.

codebuild.yaml	Creates the CodeBuild Project configured for your EKS deployment pipeline.	Optional ‚Äî only if using CodeBuild for deploy.	After networking & EKS are ready.

deploy-private-eks.sh	Wrapper script to prompt you which stack to deploy (sg-endpoints, bastion, codebuild).	Run from your local machine, instead of manually deploying the above CFTs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ CodeBuild Project Setup
These files define the pipeline & deployment behavior.

File	Purpose: Where to place it	When to use it

buildspec.yml	  Instructions for CodeBuild ‚Äî builds image, pushes to ECR, deploys to EKS using parameters from SSM.	Inside the source repo connected to CodeBuild.	Always included in the repo before triggering a build.

k8s/app-template.yaml	Sample app manifest (deployment + service) with placeholders (IMAGE_URI).	Inside the repo in a k8s/ folder.	CodeBuild will apply it during the deploy phase.

set-codebuild-params.sh	Interactive script to store values (image repo, tag, cluster name, namespace, manifest path) in SSM Parameter Store.	Run from your laptop or any AWS CLI-enabled machine.	Before triggering a CodeBuild run.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Optional Extra Files
File	Purpose
codebuild-sample.zip	Contains buildspec.yml + app-template.yaml ready-to-use example.

üìú Recommended Execution Order
Infrastructure

bash
Copy
Edit
./deploy-private-eks.sh
# or deploy sg-endpoints.yaml manually if you want
‚Üí Deploy sg-endpoints.yaml first
‚Üí Deploy bastion.yaml (optional)
‚Üí Deploy codebuild.yaml (optional)

Parameter Setup

bash
Copy
Edit
./set-codebuild-params.sh
‚Üí Stores all runtime values into SSM Parameter Store.

Code & Deployment

Place buildspec.yml & k8s/app-template.yaml in your CodeBuild source repo.

Commit & push to trigger a CodeBuild build.

Verification

From Bastion or your local machine (if EKS API is reachable), check:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
